 - I have created the Client Implementation Plan and written it to the file 'Snake6/Planning/Client_Implementation_Plan.md'. The plan includes mapping each requirement in Client_Requirements.md to functions describing the interface and logic of each function. It also includes extensive documentation for each function.

You can find the Client Implementation Plan in the file [Snake6/Planning/Client_Implementation_Plan.md](Snake6/Planning/Client_Implementation_Plan.md).

 - I have written the new version of the Client Implementation Plan to the file 'Snake6/Planning/Client_Implementation_Plan.md'. The plan includes all the requirements and describes each routine in detail.
