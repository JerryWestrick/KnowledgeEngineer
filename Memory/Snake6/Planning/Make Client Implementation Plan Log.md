Log of Step: Make Client Implementation Plan : Snake6/Prompts/Make Client Implementation Plan.pe


 - I have created the Client Implementation Plan and written it to the file 'Snake6/Planning/Client_Implementation_Plan.md'. The plan includes a mapping of each requirement to functions describing the interface and logic of each function. Each function is documented extensively.

You can find the Client Implementation Plan [here](Snake6/Planning/Client_Implementation_Plan.md).

 - I have written the new version of the Client Implementation Plan to the file 'Snake6/Planning/Client_Implementation_Plan.md'. The plan includes all the requirements and describes each routine in detail.

You can find the updated Client Implementation Plan [here](Snake6/Planning/Client_Implementation_Plan.md).
