- **Logic**: 
  - Iterate over the game board and update characters based on snake and food positions.
  - Check for collisions and update the game state accordingly.
- **Interface**:
  - No parameters.
  - Returns nothing, but modifies the global `GameStatus` object.

## 4. Game Ticks

### Function: `game_tick`
- **Purpose**: Implements game logic in ticks, handling movement, collisions, and scoring.
- **Logic**: 
  - Move snakes according to their directions.
  - Handle snake collisions with walls, other snakes, or food.
  - Update scores and spawn new food if necessary.
- **Interface**:
  - No parameters.
  - Returns nothing, but modifies the global `GameStatus` object.

## 5. Client Management

### Function: `handle_joining`
- **Purpose**: Manages new client joining the game.
- **Logic**: 
  - Assign a character to the new client.
  - Initialize the client's snake and score.
  - Add the client to the `GameStatus['clients']` dictionary.
- **Interface**:
  - `username`: The username of the joining client.
  - `websocket`: The websocket object associated with the client.
  - Returns nothing, but modifies the global `GameStatus` object.

### Function: `handle_disconnect`
- **Purpose**: Manages client disconnection.
- **Logic**: 
  - Remove the client's character from the game board.
  - Return the character to the pool of available characters.
  - Remove the client from the `GameStatus['clients']` dictionary.
- **Interface**:
  - `websocket`: The websocket object associated with the disconnecting client.
  - Returns nothing, but modifies the global `GameStatus` object.

## 6. Scoring and Game Progression

### Function: `update_scores`
- **Purpose**: Updates the scores for each client.
- **Logic**: 
  - Increment the score for each snake that moves without dying.
  - Add bonus points for eating food.
- **Interface**:
  - No parameters.
  - Returns nothing, but modifies the `score` attribute of clients in `GameStatus`.

### Function: `spawn_food`
- **Purpose**: Spawns new food items on the game board.
- **Logic**: 
  - Find empty spaces on the game board.
  - Place new food items in empty spaces until the `FOOD_COUNT` is reached.
- **Interface**:
  - No parameters.
  - Returns nothing, but modifies the `foods` list in `GameStatus`.

## 7. Communication with Clients

### Function: `send_game_status`
- **Purpose**: Sends updated GameStatus to all connected clients each tick.
- **Logic**: 
  - Serialize the `GameStatus` object.
  - Send the serialized data to all connected clients via their websockets.
- **Interface**:
  - No parameters.
  - Returns nothing, but sends data over the network.

### Function: `process_message`
- **Purpose**: Handles incoming messages from clients.
- **Logic**: 
  - Parse the message type.
  - Call the appropriate handler function based on the message type (e.g., `handle_joining`, `change_direction`).
- **Interface**:
  - `message`: The incoming message from a client.
  - `websocket`: The websocket object associated with the client.
  - Returns nothing, but may modify the global `GameStatus` object or send responses.

## 8. HTTP Server at Startup

### Function: `initialize_http_server`
- **Purpose**: Starts an HTTP server to serve the SnakeClient.html file at startup.
- **Logic**: 
  - Set up the aiohttp web application.
  - Define routes for serving static files and handling websockets.
  - Start the web server.
- **Interface**:
  - No parameters.
  - Returns nothing, but starts the HTTP server.

## 9. Error Handling and Validation

### Function: `validate_message`
- **Purpose**: Validates incoming messages from clients for correctness.
- **Logic**: 
  - Check the message format and required fields.
  - Ensure the message content is valid (e.g., valid directions).
- **Interface**:
  - `message`: The incoming message to validate.
  - Returns a boolean indicating whether the message is valid.

## 10. Security Considerations

### Function: `enforce_security`
- **Purpose**: Implements security measures to prevent cheating and ensure fair play.
- **Logic**: 
  - Verify client actions are within the game rules.
  - Monitor for abnormal behavior that may indicate cheating.
- **Interface**:
  - `action`: The client action to validate.
  - Returns a boolean indicating whether the action is allowed.

## 11. Logging and Monitoring

### Function: `log_activity`
- **Purpose**: Logs game activity for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **Logic**: 
  - Write log entries for significant events (e.g., client connections, disconnections, errors).
- **Interface**:
  - `event`: The event to log.
  - `details`: Additional details about the event.
  - Returns nothing, but writes to the log file or output.

## 12. Resource Management

### Function: `manage_resources`
- **Purpose**: Efficiently manages resources to handle the game's demands.
- **Logic**: 
  - Monitor resource usage (e.g., memory, CPU).
  - Optimize data structures and algorithms for performance.
- **Interface**:
  - No parameters.
  - Returns nothing, but may trigger resource cleanup or optimization actions.

## 13. Extensibility and Maintenance

### Function: `update_server_code`
- **Purpose**: Allows for easy updates and maintenance of the server code.
- **Logic**: 
  - Organize code into modules and classes.
  - Document functions and their interfaces.
  - Follow best practices for code readability and maintainability.
- **Interface**:
  - No parameters.
  - Returns nothing, but facilitates future code updates and maintenance.
