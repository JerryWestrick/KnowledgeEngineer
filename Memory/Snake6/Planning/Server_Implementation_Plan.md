# Server Implementation Plan for Snake Online Game

This document outlines the implementation plan for the server-side of the Snake Online Game, mapping each requirement to specific functions and detailing the interface and logic of each function.

## Python 3 and Async IO (Requirement 1)

### Function: `start_server`
- **Interface**: `async def start_server(host: str, port: int)`
- **Logic**:
  - Initialize the main server coroutine.
  - Set up the event loop for asynchronous operations.
  - Call `web.run_app` with the application instance, host, and port.

## aiohttp Web Server (Requirement 2)

### Function: `setup_routes`
- **Interface**: `def setup_routes(app: web.Application)`
- **Logic**:
  - Configure routes for the aiohttp application.
  - Add a route to serve the SnakeClient.html file.

## WebSockets Support (Requirement 3)

### Function: `websocket_handler`
- **Interface**: `async def websocket_handler(request: web.Request)`
- **Logic**:
  - Establish a WebSocket connection with the client.
  - Handle incoming WebSocket messages and disconnections.
  - Call appropriate functions based on message types (e.g., `handle_joining`, `handle_direction_change`).

## Game Board Management (Requirement 4)

### Function: `initialize_game_board`
- **Interface**: `def initialize_game_board() -> str`
- **Logic**:
  - Create a string representing the initial state of the game board with spaces.

### Function: `update_game_board`
- **Interface**: `def update_game_board(snake: list, food: list)`
- **Logic**:
  - Update the game board with the positions of snakes and food.
  - Check for collisions and update the game state accordingly.

## Game Ticks (Requirement 5)

### Function: `game_tick`
- **Interface**: `async def game_tick()`
- **Logic**:
  - Perform game logic for each tick, such as moving snakes and handling food.
  - Send updated game status to all clients.

## Snake Movement and Collision Detection (Requirement 6)

### Function: `move_snake`
- **Interface**: `def move_snake(snake_info: dict)`
- **Logic**:
  - Calculate the new head position based on the current direction.
  - Check for collisions and handle snake death if necessary.

## Score and Food Management (Requirement 7)

### Function: `handle_food_consumption`
- **Interface**: `def handle_food_consumption(snake_info: dict)`
- **Logic**:
  - Update the score when a snake eats food.
  - Add new food to the game board.

## Client Management (Requirement 8)

### Function: `assign_snake_character`
- **Interface**: `def assign_snake_character(username: str) -> str`
- **Logic**:
  - Assign a free snake character to a new client.
  - Update the list of available characters.

### Function: `reset_client`
- **Interface**: `def reset_client(username: str)`
- **Logic**:
  - Reset the client's snake to a random position.
  - Set the score to zero and direction to "Stop".

## Handling Client Messages (Requirement 9)

### Function: `handle_joining`
- **Interface**: `def handle_joining(username: str)`
- **Logic**:
  - Process the "Joining" message from a client.
  - Assign a character and reset the client's game state.

### Function: `handle_direction_change`
- **Interface**: `def handle_direction_change(username: str, direction: str)`
- **Logic**:
  - Update the direction of the client's snake based on the message.

## Client Disconnection (Requirement 10)

### Function: `handle_disconnection`
- **Interface**: `def handle_disconnection(username: str)`
- **Logic**:
  - Handle client disconnection.
  - Return the snake character to the pool and remove the snake from the game board.

## Sending Game Status (Requirement 11)

### Function: `send_game_status`
- **Interface**: `async def send_game_status()`
- **Logic**:
  - Send the current game status to all connected clients.

## HTTP Server Startup (Requirement 12)

### Function: `run_http_server`
- **Interface**: `def run_http_server()`
- **Logic**:
  - Start the HTTP server to serve the SnakeClient.html file.

## Error Handling (Requirement 13)

### Function: `handle_exceptions`
- **Interface**: `def handle_exceptions(exception: Exception)`
- **Logic**:
  - Log the exception.
  - Ensure the server continues to operate for other clients.

Each function will be extensively documented with docstrings, detailing the parameters, return values, and any exceptions that may be raised.
