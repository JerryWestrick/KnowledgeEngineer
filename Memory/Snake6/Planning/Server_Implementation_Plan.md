# Server Implementation Plan for Snake Online Game

This document outlines the implementation plan for the server-side of the Snake Online Game, mapping each requirement to specific functions with their interfaces and logic.

## 1. Python 3 and Async IO

### Function: `start_server`
- **Interface**: `async def start_server(host: str, port: int)`
- **Logic**:
  - Initialize the server using `asyncio` and `aiohttp`.
  - Set up the server to listen on the specified `host` and `port`.
  - Start the event loop.

## 2. aiohttp Web Server

### Function: `serve_client_html`
- **Interface**: `async def serve_client_html(request)`
- **Logic**:
  - Serve the `SnakeClient.html` file in response to HTTP GET requests.
  - Utilize `aiohttp.web.FileResponse` to send the static file.

## 3. WebSocket Support

### Function: `websocket_handler`
- **Interface**: `async def websocket_handler(request)`
- **Logic**:
  - Upgrade the HTTP connection to a WebSocket connection.
  - Manage incoming WebSocket messages and handle client interactions.

## 4. Game Board Management

### Function: `update_game_board`
- **Interface**: `def update_game_board()`
- **Logic**:
  - Iterate over the game board and update the positions of snakes and food.
  - Check for collisions and update the game state accordingly.

## 5. Game Tick Logic

### Function: `game_tick`
- **Interface**: `async def game_tick()`
- **Logic**:
  - Implement the tick logic as described, moving snakes and handling food consumption.
  - Schedule the next tick using `asyncio.sleep`.

## 6. Snake Lifecycle Management

### Function: `snake_dies`
- **Interface**: `def snake_dies(client)`
- **Logic**:
  - Handle the death of a snake, including sending the `SnakeDied` message and resetting the client.

### Function: `reset_a_client`
- **Interface**: `def reset_a_client(client)`
- **Logic**:
  - Reset a client's snake, score, and direction when their snake dies or when they join the game.

## 7. Client Management

### Function: `handle_joining`
- **Interface**: `def handle_joining(client, username)`
- **Logic**:
  - Assign a free snake character to a new client and initialize their game state.

### Function: `handle_disconnect`
- **Interface**: `def handle_disconnect(client)`
- **Logic**:
  - Handle client disconnection, returning the snake character to the pool and cleaning up the game state.

## 8. Communication with Clients

### Function: `broadcast_game_status`
- **Interface**: `async def broadcast_game_status()`
- **Logic**:
  - Send the updated `GameStatus` to all connected clients after each tick.

### Function: `handle_incoming_message`
- **Interface**: `async def handle_incoming_message(client, message)`
- **Logic**:
  - Process incoming messages such as `Joining` and `DirectionChange` and update the game state.

## 9. Server Startup Behavior

### Function: `initialize_game_state`
- **Interface**: `def initialize_game_state()`
- **Logic**:
  - Set up the initial game state, including the game board and food positions.

## 10. Error Handling and Validation

### Function: `validate_message`
- **Interface**: `def validate_message(message)`
- **Logic**:
  - Validate incoming messages from clients to ensure they conform to the expected format.

### Function: `handle_error`
- **Interface**: `def handle_error(client, error)`
- **Logic**:
  - Log errors and handle them gracefully to maintain a consistent game state.

## 11. Resource Management

### Function: `optimize_resources`
- **Interface**: `def optimize_resources()`
- **Logic**:
  - Implement strategies to manage memory and network resources efficiently.

## 12. Security Considerations

### Function: `sanitize_input`
- **Interface**: `def sanitize_input(input)`
- **Logic**:
  - Sanitize inputs from clients to prevent injection attacks and cheating.

### Function: `secure_client_session`
- **Interface**: `def secure_client_session(client)`
- **Logic**:
  - Implement session management to ensure secure communication with clients.

Each function will be thoroughly documented, including descriptions of parameters, return values, and any exceptions that may be raised. The implementation will follow best practices for asynchronous programming in Python 3, ensuring that the server is efficient, scalable, and secure.
