Log of Step: Make Server Implementation Plan : Snake6/Prompts/Make Server Implementation Plan.pe


 - The task has been completed.

 - Upon reviewing the implementation plan, it appears that all requirements from the `Server_Requirements.md` file have been addressed in the plan. Each requirement has been mapped to one or more functions, and the interface and logic of each function have been described in detail.

The plan includes functions for:
- Starting the server and setting up asynchronous operations (`start_server`).
- Setting up routes for the aiohttp web server (`setup_routes`).
- Handling WebSocket connections and messages (`websocket_handler`).
- Initializing and updating the game board (`initialize_game_board`, `update_game_board`).
- Processing game ticks (`game_tick`).
- Moving snakes and detecting collisions (`move_snake`).
- Managing scores and food (`handle_food_consumption`).
- Managing clients, including assigning characters and resetting clients (`assign_snake_character`, `reset_client`).
- Handling client messages such as joining and direction changes (`handle_joining`, `handle_direction_change`).
- Handling client disconnections (`handle_disconnection`).
- Sending the game status to clients (`send_game_status`).
- Starting the HTTP server (`run_http_server`).
- Handling exceptions (`handle_exceptions`).

Each function is documented with its purpose, interface, and logic, providing a clear understanding of how the server will handle the various aspects of the game.

No changes are necessary to the implementation plan, as it covers all the requirements and provides a comprehensive description of the server-side functions. Therefore, the file `Snake6/Planning/Server_Implementation_Plan.md` does not need to be rewritten.
